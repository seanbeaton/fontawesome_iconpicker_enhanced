# To use a custom list of icons (pro icons, for example)

1. Go to FA Download page:

https://fontawesome.com/download

2. Download desktop version (whichever one you want to use, pro/free).

3. Take the metadata/icons.json file and place it into the fontawesome directory of this module

4. Run `npm install`, then `gulp`.

If you do not do this, it will use the free icons by default.
